# 📚 Zizhi

### Smarter reading, powered by AI

**Zizhi** is a next-generation reading experience — an AI-assisted EPUB reader that transforms books into interactive, intelligent companions. It’s designed for readers who want more than just text — for those who want to *understand*, *connect*, and *converse* with what they read.

---

## 🚀 Current Features

* **EPUB Reader** — Upload and read your books in a clean, distraction-free interface.
* **Quote & Share** — Highlight text and instantly generate *image quotes* to share.
* **Smart Highlight Menu** — When you select text, you can:

  * Copy
  * Quote (saves to your quotes tab)
  * Search
* **Quotes Tab** — View and manage your saved highlights, grouped by book, with quick navigation to the original text.
* **Custom Selection System** — Overwrites the default browser text selection to provide a tailored highlighting experience.

## 🧠 In Progress

* **Reading Progress Tracking** — Implementing a more accurate, page-based progress calculation to replace the current chapter-level system.
* **AI Audio Summaries** — Experimenting with short, AI-generated *audio overviews* to help users decide what to read.
* **Conversational Reading Assistant** — Integrating with **Google AI Studio** to let users:

  * Upload an EPUB
  * Generate an AI summary
  * Ask questions about the book before reading
  * Eventually chat with the text while reading
